## Why are you and your team well-suited for this project?

We are relatively new in crypto world, but extremely enthusiastic. We have just finished Zero Knowledge Proof course which introduced us to many concepts in crypto world. With Software Engineering backround in one of top techno companies in the world and passiong of learning and building crypto we believe we could help improve GNO. Prototyping it for the Etheereum also gives us an experience where the bottlenecks could lie.
